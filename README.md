# Data Extraction and Text Analysis

## Objective
The objective of this project is to extract textual data from a list of articles provided in an Excel file and perform text analysis to compute various linguistic and readability metrics. The results of this analysis are saved in a structured output format.

## Approach
### Data Extraction
1. Read the list of URLs from `Input.xlsx`.
2. Extract the article title and text from each URL using web scraping libraries (BeautifulSoup, Selenium, Scrapy).
3. Save the extracted text in the `extracted_texts/` directory with filenames corresponding to their `URL_ID`.

### Text Analysis
1. Load each extracted text file from the `extracted_texts/` directory.
2. Compute the required textual metrics (Positive Score, Negative Score, Polarity Score, etc.) using NLP libraries (NLTK, TextBlob).
3. Save the computed metrics in the `results/` directory in the format specified in `Output Data Structure.xlsx`.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
```sh
pip install beautifulsoup4 selenium scrapy nltk textblob openpyxl
```

## How to Run the Scripts
### Data Extraction
1. Ensure `Input.xlsx` is in the project directory.
2. Run the data extraction script:
   ```sh
   python data_extraction.py
   ```
3. Extracted texts will be saved in the `extracted_texts/` directory.

### Text Analysis
1. Ensure `extracted_texts/` directory contains the extracted text files.
2. Run the text analysis script:
   ```sh
   python text_analysis.py
   ```
3. Computed metrics will be saved in the `results/` directory.

## Variables
The variables computed during text analysis include:
1. Positive Score
2. Negative Score
3. Polarity Score
4. Subjectivity Score
5. Average Sentence Length
6. Percentage of Complex Words
7. Fog Index
8. Average Number of Words per Sentence
9. Complex Word Count
10. Word Count
11. Syllables per Word
12. Personal Pronouns
13. Average Word Length

Detailed definitions and explanations for these variables can be found in `Text Analysis.docx`.

## Notes
- Ensure your web scraping script respects the website's `robots.txt` file and terms of service.
- Handle exceptions and errors gracefully, especially for URLs that may not be accessible or structured differently.
- Validate the output against the `Output Data Structure.xlsx` template to ensure consistency.
